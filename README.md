Wichita State CS797O Neural Nets and Deep Learning.

Repository for personal work for Wichita State's CS797O Neural Nets and Deep Learning course.

Assigments include design and creation of neural networks from scratch up through vanilla neural nets. The course and repo concludes with a culminating individual project that attempts to recreate a low-altitude object detection oalgorithm based on convolutional neural networks.
